# ** Setup Pin Mapping **
# Pins mapping section.  There must be an entry for each pin 0..15
# Each pin must be mapped to a unique Button name.  These
# button names are then used in the emulator sections below to map the emulator 
# button name, to one of our led button names.  It is recommended to
# continue using the pre-defined B1-B16 names.
