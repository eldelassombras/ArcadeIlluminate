# ** Setup Pin Mapping **
# Pins mapping section.  There must be an entry for each pin 0..15
# Each pin must be mapped to a unique Button name.  These
# button names are then used in the emulator sections below to map the emulator 
# button name, to one of our led button names.  It is recommended to
# continue using the pre-defined B1-B16 names.

# NOTE:
# There is a very important naming convention that should be used when
# defining a button name for a particular emulator section.  All button names
# should start with a "Pn_" prefix, where n is the player number 1,2,3...n
# This allows the illuminate script to compensate for incomplete entries
# in the xml setup file.  For example, the game "goldnaxe" in the mame-mame4all.xml
# script is not quite complete.  It indicates a 2 player game that can play 
# simultaneously, yet the game section contains only a single "Player" sub
# section.  the 2nd player sub-section is not included.  the illuminate
# script will recognize this and auto-generate a player 2 button list
# based on the contents of the player1 buttons.  the P1_ prefixes
# will be converted to P2_ prefixes.


# This specialized "emulator" section is used by the illuminate the buttons when back into Emulation Station.
